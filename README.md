# Book Recommendation System.


A content-based book recommendation system that analyzes the summaries of books and recommends books with similar plotlines and genres. The data used is from the CMU Book Summaries dataset. 

The easiest way to run this algorithm yourself would be to fork my [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/shoaibmnagi/book-recommendation-system) and run the code. If you want to download the code and run it on your own machine, I would recommend you to use 'linear_kernel' instead of 'cosine_similarity' if you don't have a GPU. It significantly reduces computation time.
